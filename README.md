# Scientific Computing with Scala

This code is for scientists and engineers who would like to use Scala for their
scientific and numerical computing needs. Basic familiarity with undergraduate-level mathematics and statistics is expected but not strictly required. Basic knowledge of Scala is required as well as the ability to write simple Scala programs. Complicated programming concepts are not used in the book. Anyone who wants to explore using Scala for writing scientific or engineering software will benefit from the book.
